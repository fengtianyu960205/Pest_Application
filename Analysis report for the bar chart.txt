The bar chart above shows the distribution of different types of species in different states. Among them, NSW and QLD are more widely distributed, and weeds are more abundant than pests. In addition, we also found that states with more weeds also have relatively more pests. From this, we can guess that the number of weeds has a certain positive correlation with these pests. But to prove this prediction, more data and models are needed.
