<h3>About Extreme Pests Crew Android App</h3>
<p> Pests, invasive specious and woody weeds cause enormous damage in Australia to the environment, agriculture and society. The Department of Environment and Heritage states that invasive wild animals cause immense damage to soils, native plants and species. The natural habitats of one of 20 native species has been destroyed by invasive animals. Which is important to ensure tourists can understand the dangers of invasive species and pests as well as learning ways to avoid significant damage to their safety and the environment.\n
